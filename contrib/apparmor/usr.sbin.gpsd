# WARNING: using gps with apparmor will drive you crazy and is not recommended.
# gpsd depends on system libraries that change frequently.  They use
# system calls that change frequently for many reasons.  Thus no whitelist
# will ever be correct.  You will be playing whack-a-mole.
#
# Apparmor profiles are meant to cover and allow for the most common use
# cases and that is what this profile tries to cover. Due to the nature of
# the program there are various different use-cases and if you trigger
# apparmor denies (see dmesg and journal) it is recommended to add matching
# local overrides for your use-case. See:
# gitlab.com/apparmor/apparmor/-/blob/master/profiles/apparmor.d/local/README
# This way your changes do not conflict with further updates of the program.
#
# If you consider this use case common please report a bug upstream so that
# the rule can be added to the default profile.
#
# If instead you are just frustrated and want to get it silenced it is
# recommended to set it to complain mode:
#  $ sudo aa-complain usr.sbin.gpsd
# That way nothing will be blocked anymore, but you will be able to see and
# report the denials of your use case. That way there is a chance to update
# the default profile for it.
