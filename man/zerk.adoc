== NAME

zerk - All purpose GREIS fitting

== OPTIONS

*zerk* [OPTIONS] [server[:port[:device]]]

*zerk* -h

*zerk* -V

== DESCRIPTION

*zerk* is an all purpose GREIS (GNSS Receiver External Interface
Specification) fitting. If you do not have a Javad GPS that speaks
the GREIS protocol then you can stop reading now.

This tool operates with your Javad GPS at a very low level. To
understand *zerk* you must first be familiar with your Javad GPS and the
documentation for the GREIS protocol.
https://www.javad.com/downloads/javadgnss/manuals/GREIS/GREIS_Reference_Guide.pdf[GREIS Guide].

*zerk* can decode common GREIS messages, poll the GPS status, enable and
disable GPS features, and send user-generated commands to the GPS. It
can read GREIS messages from a file. It can read and write directly
through a serial device, or through a running *gpsd* instance.

*zerk* does not require root privileges, except maybe to access the
serial port in direct mode.  It will run fine as root.  Running under
sudo will cause loss of functionality.

== OPTIONS

The program accepts the following options:

*-?*, *-h*::
  Makes *zerk* print a usage message and exit.
*-c COMMAND*::
  Send a text string to the GPS. Accepts one parameter, COMMAND, the
  command string to send to the GPS. The string is sent verbatim, except
  a newline is appended.
*-d OPTION*::
  Disable an option in the GPS. Accepts one parameter, OPTION, the
  option to disable. *zerk* will exit after the GPS acknowledges the
  command, unless the *-W* is given.

4HZ;;
Disable basic GREIS messages at 4Hz. The messages
are: [RT], [UO], [GT], [PV], [SG], [DP], [SI], [EL], [AZ], [EC], [SS], and [ET]
COMPASS;;
Disable use of the COMPASS (BeiDou) constellation.
CONS;;
Disable use of all constellations.
DEFMSG;;
Disable the default message set (/dev/msg) at 1Hz.
GALILEO;;
Disable use of the GALILEO constellation.
GLONASS;;
Disable use of the GLONASS constellation.
GPS;;
Disable use of the GPS constellation.
IPR;;
Disable all Integer Pseudo Range messages. These are [rx], [rc],
[r1], [r2], [r3], [r5], [rl].
IRNSS;;
Disable use of the IRNSS constellation.
NMEA;;
Disable basic NMEA 4.1e messages at 4Hz. The messages are GBS, GGA,
GSA, GST, GSV, RMC, VTG, and ZDA.
QZSS;;
Disable use of the QZSS constellation.
SBAS;;
Disable use of the SBAS constellation.
SNR;;
Disable all SNR messages, except [EC]. The messages disabled are:
[E1], [E2], [E3], [E5], [El].

*-e OPTION*::
Enable an option in the GPS. Accepts one parameter, OPTION, the option
to enable. *zerk* will exit after the GPS acknowledges the command,
unless the *-W* is given. *-e* accepts the same OPTIONs as *-d*, except the
action is to enable the option.
*-f FILE*::
Connect to a file or device. Accepts one parameter, FILE, the file or
device to open. Files are opened read-only. Character devices are
opened read/write, unless the -r parameter is given. Requires the
pyserial module.
*-O OAF*::
Load an Option Authorization File (OAF) into the GPS. Accepts one
parameter, OAF, command file to read. The OAF is just a special case
of a '.jpo' (GREIS command file). -O will send any valid .jpo file to
the GPS.
*-p PRESET*::
Send a preset command the GPS. Accepts one parameter, PRESET, the name
of the command to send. *zerk* will exit after the GPS acknowledges the
command, unless the *-W* is given.

COLDBOOT;;
Coldboot the GPS.
CONS;;
Poll the enabled constellations.
DM;;
Disable all periodic GREIS messages.
ID;;
Poll the receiver ID.
IPR;;
Poll all Integer Pseudo Range messages. These are [rx], [rc], [r1],
[r2], [r3], [r5], [rl].
OAF;;
Poll all OAF options.
RESET;;
Reset (reboot) the GPS.
SERIAL;;
Poll receiver serial number.
SNR;;
Poll all Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) messages. [EC], [E1], [E2],
[E3], [E5], [El].
VENDOR;;
Poll GPS vendor.
VER;;
Poll GPS version.

*-r*::
Read only. Do not send anything to the GPS.
*-R RAW*::
Save all raw data from the GPS into the file RAW.
*-S SPEED*::
Configure the GPS serial speed to SPEED bps.
*-s SPEED*::
Set local serial port speed to SPEED bps. Default 115,200 bps.
*-V*::
Print *zerk* version and exit.
*-v VERBOSITY*::
Set verbosity level to VERBOSITY. Verbosity can be from 0 (very
quiet), to 4 (very noisy). Default 2.
*-W*::
Force waiting the entire wait time. No early exit for completion of
*-d*, *-e* or *-p* command.
*-w WAIT*::
Wait for WAIT seconds before exiting. Will exit early on command
completion of *-d*, *-e* or *-p* command, unless *-W* is given. Default 2.0
second.

== ARGUMENTS

By default, clients collect data from the local *gpsd* daemon running
on localhost, using the default GPSD port 2947. The optional argument
to any client may override this behavior: *[server[:port[:device]]]*

For further explanation, and examples, see the *ARGUMENTS* section in
the *gps*(1) man page

== ENVIRONMENT

Options can be placed in the ZERKOPTS environment variable. ZERKOPTS is
processed before the CLI options.

== EXAMPLES

Print current Javad serial port of GPS connected to local running
*gpsd*:

----
 zerk -c "print,/cur/term"
----

Decode raw log file:

----
zerk -r -f greis-binary.log -v 2
----

Change GPS port speed of device on /dev/ttyAMA0 to 230,400 bps:

----
zerk -S 230400 -f /dev/ttyAMA0
----

Watch entire GPS reset cycle:

----
zerk -p RESET -v 2 -w 20 -W
----

Poll SVs Status:

----
zerk -W -w 2 -v 2 -c "out,,jps/{CS,ES,GS,Is,WS,QS}"
----

Dump *gpsd* data from remote server:

----
zerk -v 2 -w 5 server
----

== RETURN VALUES

*0*:: on success.
*1*:: on failure

== SEE ALSO

*zerk* is written to conform to the official Javad documentation for the
GREIS protocol.
