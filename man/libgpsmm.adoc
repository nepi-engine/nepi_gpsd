== NAME

libgpsmm, libQgpsm - C++ and QT class wrappers for the GPS daemon

== SYNOPSIS

$$C++:$$

$$#include <libgpsmm>$$

struct gps_data_t * open(char * host char * port)

struct gps_data_t * open(void)

struct gps_data_t * send(char * request)

struct gps_data_t * read(void)

struct gps_data_t * waiting(int)

struct gps_data_t * stream unsigned(int flags)

== DESCRIPTION

_libgpsmm_ and _libQgpsmm_ are mere wrappers over _libgps_. The important
difference between the libraries is that _libgpsmm_ is targeted at C++
applications and contained in _libgps_, while _libQgpsmm_ is platform
independent by using _QTcpSocket_ to connect to _gpsd_ and shipped as an
additional library due to the necessary linking to QT. Method names are
the same as the analogue C functions. For a detailed description of the
functions please read libgps(3). `open()` must be called after class
constructor and before any other method (open()` is not inside the
constructor since it may fail, however constructors have no return
value). The analogue of the C function `gps_close()` is in the
destructor.
