WARNING: This document assumes you are using gpsd from git head, or
version 3.22 or higher.  Using older gpsd versions will fail in strange
ways.

== Introduction

The u-blox GNSS receivers have a huge number of configuration options.
Most users will be perfectly happy running their receiver in its default
configuration, but there are often times when users get the itch to
change settings to see what happens.  Sometimes even for good reasons.

IMPORTANT: Feel free to jump around this document to recipes that
interest you, but be sure to first read all of, and comply with, the
section on Initial Setup.

Many of the recipes repeat text from other recipes so that recipes can
stand alone.  Except all recipes require the Initial Setup section.

== Initial Setup

All the examples here assume that gpsd is running on the local host and
that cgps is showing current and valid data from the receiver.

If cgps is not showing any data, then do not bother to continue reading
this document.

You also need a copy of the "Interface Description" for your exact
u-blox device.  The examples here will refer to a lot of messages and
variables that are defined in that document.  Keep it open while reading
this document and refer to it often.

=== Sudo?  Sudon't!

For some reason some users persist in using sudo with ubxtool.  This is
wrong for many reasons:

* ubxtool never needs root access, but will run fine as root.

* sudo is *_not_* the same as running as root.  Using sudo with some of
these examples *_will_* break them.

* sudo is "Security Theater".  Having sudo enabled on a computer makes
it demonstrably less secure.

If you must be root, then become, and stay root.  Just sudon't.

=== Protocol Version

All the examples below require that you know the protocol version of
your u-blox receiver.

----
$ ubxtool -p MON-VER
----

Buried in the data will be a data block that similar one of these
examples.

A u-blox 6, assume protocol version 12

----
UBX-MON-VER:
  swVersion 6.02 (36023)
  hwVersion 00040007
----

A u-blox 8, protocol version 15

----
UBX-MON-VER:
  swVersion 2.01 (75331)
  hwVersion 00080000
  extension PROTVER 15.00
  extension GPS;SBAS;GLO;BDS;QZSS
----

The shortcut to find the PROTVER for u-blox 8 and up:

----
$ ubxtool -p MON-VER | fgrep PROT
extension PROTVER=18.00
----

The above shows the protocol version is 18.00.

The ubxtool program needs to know the protocol version (PROTVER) of
the connected receiver to send commands matched to your exact receiver's
needs.  Use the "-P XX" option for this, where XX is your version.  This
is easy to forget, and annoying to type repeatedly, so add it to your
environment and ubxtool will use it.  For example if you have an early
u-blox 8:

----
$ export UBXOPTS="-P 15"
----

You can use "-P 18 -v 2" if you have a newer u-blox 8, and for a little
more verbosity.

----
$ export UBXOPTS="-P 18 -v 2"
----


=== Default Configuration

A common problem when dealing with a u-blox GNSS receiver is left over
configuration from earlier experiments.  The u-blox receivers are very
picky about competing configuration options, and may fail to warn the
unwary of conflicts.  Best to always revert to factory defaults before
starting a new configuration.

----
$ ubxtool -p RESET
----

After a few seconds the receiver will only be sending NMEA, you will
want to enable u-blox binary messages, and disable NMEA messages.  Best
to do it in that order so the receiver does not go totally silent.  This
is one place where the "-P", set in UBXOPTS, is critically important, to
get the correct messages for your firmware.

----
$ ubxtool -e BINARY
$ ubxtool -d NMEA
----

== ACK-ACK

ACK-ACK is the sound of a cat coughing up a hairball.  Otherwise it is
not of much use to us.  The u-blox documentation claims that every well
formed CFG message sent to one of their GNSS receivers will receive a
UBX-ACK-ACK or UBX-ACK-NAK in response.  That is not always true.  Valid
messages may elicit no ACK-ACK or ACK-NAK.  Invalid ones may invoke an
ACK-ACK, yet not be executed.  The only thing you can count on is that
an ACK-NAK meant you sent something invalid.

Always double check that any settings changed stuck.

This text, and these examples will ignore ACK-ACK responses.  If any
cause an ACK-NAK for you then you either found a bug in this document, your
receiver does not support the requested operation, or you mistyped
something.

== Dynamic Platform Model

The most common variable mis-configured in a u-blox receiver is the
Dynamic Platform Model.  The receiver uses noisy measurements of
satellite signals and attempts to interpret those as single PVT fix.
By default the receiver assumes the receiver is "Portable" and not
experiencing large accelerations.  Place that receiver in a car or
airplane, and the smoothing will act perversely on the fix.  Take a
moment now to read the section on Platform Settings in your u-blox
documentation.  Different receivers support different models, so no
generic recommendations are possible.

Check your current Dynamic Platform Model:

----
$ ubxtool -p CFG-NAV5
UBX-CFG-NAV5:
 mask 0xffff dynModel 0 fixmode 3 fixedAlt 0 FixedAltVar 10000
 minElev 5 drLimit 0 pDop 250 tDop 250 pAcc 100 tAcc 350
 staticHoldThresh 0 dgpsTimeOut 60 cnoThreshNumSVs 0
 cnoThresh 0 res 0 staticHoldMaxDist 0 utcStandard 0
 reserved x0 0
   dynModel (Portable) fixMode (Auto 2D/3D) utcStandard (Default)
   mask (dyn minEl posFixMode drLim posMask timeMask staticHoldMask
         dgpsMask cnoThreshold utc)
----

That shows the receiver is in the default Portable model.

To change the active model to Automotive (4), and check it again,
is simply:

----
$ ubxtool -p MODEL,4
[...]
$ ubxtool -p CFG-NAV5
UBX-CFG-NAV5:
 mask 0xffff dynModel 4 fixmode 3 fixedAlt 0 FixedAltVar 10000
 minElev 5 drLimit 0 pDop 250 tDop 250 pAcc 100 tAcc 350
 staticHoldThresh 0 dgpsTimeOut 60 cnoThreshNumSVs 0
 cnoThresh 0 res 0 staticHoldMaxDist 0 utcStandard 0
 reserved x0 0
   dynModel (Automotive) fixMode (Auto 2D/3D) utcStandard (Default)
   mask (dyn minEl posFixMode drLim posMask timeMask staticHoldMask
         dgpsMask cnoThreshold utc)
----


=== With Configuration Items

If the receiver is a 9-series, then you can change the model using
Configuration Items.  These allow you to get, set and delete individual
settings in the receiver. Before continuing this section, read the
ubxtool man page on Configuration Items.

The CFG-NAVSPG Configuration Item group includes the CFG-NAV5 items
of interest here.  So take a look at them, in the ram layer:

----

    item CFG-NAVSPG-USRDAT_FLAT/0x50110063 val 298.257223563
----

We can now use CFG-NAVSPG-DYNMODEL to change the model back to
Pedestrian, and then confirm the setting:

----
$ ubxtool -z CFG-NAVSPG-DYNMODEL,0
[...]
$ ubxtool -g CFG-NAVSPG-DYNMODEL,0
[...]
UBX-CFG-VALGET:
 version 1 layer 0 position 0
  layers (ram)
    item CFG-NAVSPG-DYNMODEL/0x20110021 val 0
----

== Rate Settings

There can be a good need to change the rate at which your receiver takes
measurements, or how many measurements it uses to compute its navigation
solution (fix).  Slow down the measurement rate to save power.  Or speed
it up in fast moving dynamic environments.  Using several measurements
sets for each fix computation may remove some noise.  No one size
fits all.

NOTE: Not all u-blox can take measurements faster than 1 Hz.

The current configuration can be seen this way:

----
$ ubxtool -p CFG-RATE
[...]
UBX-CFG-RATE:
 measRate 1000 navRate 1 timeRef 1 (GPS)
----

To change to a 10 Hz measurement and fix rate, then check your work:

----
$ ubxtool -p RATE,100
[...]
$ ubxtool -p CFG-RATE
[...]
UBX-CFG-RATE:
 measRate 000 navRate 1 timeRef 1 (GPS)
----

The parameter to the RATE command is the number of milliseconds.

=== Rate Settings with Configuration Items

If the receiver is a 9-series, then you can change the rate at which
the receiver takes measurements and/or computes the navigation solution
(fix) using Configuration Items.  These allow you to get, set and delete
individual settings in the receiver. Before continuing this section,
read the ubxtool man page on Configuration Items.

The CFG-NAVSPG Configuration Item group includes the CFG-NAV5 items
of interest here.  So take a look at them, in the ram layer:

----
# ubxtool -g CFG-RATE,0
[...]
UBX-CFG-VALGET:
 version 1 layer 0 position 0
  layers (ram)
    item CFG-RATE-TIMEREF/0x20210003 val 1
    item CFG-RATE-MEAS/0x30210001 val 1000
    item CFG-RATE-NAV/0x30210002 val 1
----

You can change the measurement rate to 0.1 Hz, and check it, this way:

----
$ ubxtool -z CFG-RATE-MEAS,10000,1
sent:
UBX-CFG-VALSET:
 version 0 layer 0x1 transaction 0x0 reserved 0
  layers (ram) transaction (Transactionless)
    item CFG-RATE-MEAS/0x30210001 val 10000

UBX-ACK-ACK:
  ACK to Class x06 (CFG) ID x8a (VALSET)
[...]
$ ubxtool -g CFG-RATE-MEAS,1
[...]
UBX-CFG-VALGET:
 version 1 layer 0 position 0
  layers (ram)
    item CFG-RATE-MEAS/0x30210001 val 10000
----

== Logging

Sometimes you want your GNSS receiver to be able to log PVT fixes for
later retrieval.  This allows the host to go into sleep mode to save
power.  Logs are stored in external flash memory.  Some GNSS receivers,
like the NEO-M8B, allow the receiver to go into sleep mode between fixes
to save even more power.

Be sure you have performed all the steps in Initial Setup before
proceeding to the following logging specific steps.

=== Logging Prerequisites

For logging, you need:

1. u-blox 7, 8 or 9 GNSS receiver (protocol version greater than, or equal to, 15)

2. External SQI flash memory with a valid Flash Information Structure (FIS).

By default EVK boards and other commercial products with flash will
already have a valid FIS.  Added or replaced flash will need to have
an FIS created.  If your receiver has flash, but no valid FIS, you can
create a new FIS with u-center.

If you do not meet the above prerequisites, then you can stop reading
this section now.

The easy way to see if your firmware supports logging is to ask it:

----
$ ubxtool -p LOG-INFO
----

There are three possible results.

One, the receiver does not return ACK-ACK, ACK-NAK, or any UBX-LOG-INFO
message.  That means your receiver does not support logging.  Game over,
your receiver does not support logging.

Two, the receiver returns something similar to this:

----
    UBX-LOG-INFO:
      version 1 reserved1 x0 x0 filestoreCapacity 0 reserved2 x0 x0
      currentMaxLogSize 0 currentLogSize 0 entryCount 0
      oldestYear 0 oldestMonth 0 oldestDay 0

      newestYear 0 newestMonth 0 newestDay 0
      newestHour 0 newestMin 0 newestSec 0 reserved4 x0
      status x10 reserved5 x0 x0
----

The filestoreCapacity of zero means you have no flash for logging to
use.  Game over, your receiver does not support logging.

Three, the receiver returns something similar to this:

----
    UBX-LOG-INFO:
      version 1 reserved1 x0 x0 filestoreCapacity 487680 reserved2 x9600 x24900
      currentMaxLogSize 134400 currentLogSize 61 entryCount 0

      newestYear 0 newestMonth 0 newestDay 0
      newestHour 0 newestMin 0 newestSec 0 reserved4 x0
      status x20 reserved5 x0 x0
----

That means your receiver has almost 500 kB of flash, and about 134 kB is
available for logging.  Congratulations, your receiver supports logging.
Proceed to the next section on configuration.

=== Logging Configuration

Be sure you have completed the instructions in the section
Initial Setup before continuing here.

Erase any exiting log:

----

== Batching

U-blox batching is like logging, but logging is saved in flash memory,
and batching is saved in RAM memory.  Not all u-blox receivers have RAM
available for batching.

Be sure you have performed all the steps in Initial Setup before
proceeding to these batching specific steps.

=== Batching Prerequisites

For batching, you need:

1. u-blox 8 or 9 GNSS receiver (protocol version 23.01 or greater)

2. RAM memory

If you do not meet the above prerequisites, then you can stop reading
now.

The easy way to see if your firmware supports batching is to ask it:

----
$ ubxtool -p MON-BATCH
----

If the receiver does not ACK, or NAK, that request, then it does not
support batching.  Game over, do not bother to continue with this
example.

If your receiver does support batching, you will see something
similar to this:

----
$ ubxtool -p MON-BATCH
ubxtool: poll MON-BATCH

sent:
UBX-MON-BATCH:
  Poll request

UBX-MON-BATCH:
   version 0 reserved1 0 0 0 fillLevel 128
   dropsAll 65535 dropsSinceMon 4 nextMsgCnt 166
----

Check your u-blox documentation for what UBX-MON-BATCH just told you.

=== Batching Configuration

Be sure you have completed the instructions in the section
Initial Setup before continuing here.

Enable batching:

----
$ ubxtool -e BATCH
----

Wait, then verify:

----
$ ubxtool -p CFG-BATCH -p MON-BATCH -v 2
[...]
UBX-CFG-BATCH:
  version 0 flags xd bufsize 128 notifThrs 0
  pioId 0 reserved1 0

UBX-MON-BATCH:
   version 0 reserved1 0 0 0 fillLevel 128
   dropsAll 321 dropsSinceMon 15 nextMsgCnt 38
[...]
----

Wait a while, for some fixes to be saved in the BATCH.  Then check
UBX-MON-BATCH and get all the batch entries:

----
$ ubxtool -p LOG-RETRIEVEBATCH -v 2
[...]
UBX-MON-BATCH:

----

There will be a number of UBX-LOG-BATCH with each of the individual
batches fixes.

End batching:

----
$ ubxtool -d BATCH
----

== Survey-In and RTCM

Sometimes your GNSS antenna is fixed and instead of having your receiver
compute its position, you want it to use the known position to provide a
more accurate PPS, or to compute the errors it sees in the signals it
measures.  Corrections can then be transmitted to a nearby receiver.

The receiver with the fixed antenna is called the base, and the nearby
receiver is a rover.  The corrections are usually in one of the many
RTCM2 or RTCM3 variants.

Some u-blox receivers with protocol versions of 20 or greater output
RTCM3 corrections.  None output RTCM2 corrections.

Be sure you have completed the instructions in the section Initial Setup
before continuing here.  To understand the following example you should
have read the Survey-in section from the u-blox documentation for your
receiver.

=== Survey-In and RTCM Prerequisites

For base mode, you need a u-blox receiver that supports UBX-CFG-TMODE2
or UBX-CFG-TMODE3. This is usually limited to Time & Frequency Sync, Time
Sync, or High Precision products.

Your receiver supports the High Precision messages if it answers the
UBX-NAV-SVIN message:

----
$ ubxtool -p NAV-SVIN -P 27.11
ubxtool: poll NAV-SVIN

sent:
UBX-NAV-SVIN:

  meanXHP -30 meanYHP 9 meanZHP -14 reserved2 0 meanAcc 199922
  obs 101 valid 1 active 0
----

Your receiver supports the Timing messages if it answers the
UBX-TIM-SVIN message:

----
# ubxtool -p TIM-SVIN -P 22
ubxtool: poll TIM-SVIN

sent:
UBX-TIM-SVIN:

UBX-TIM-SVIN:

  obs 31 valid 0 active 0
----

If your receiver responds to neither request, then you can use Survey-in.

=== Survey-In Configuration

If your receiver responded to UBX-NAV-SVIN, then you start the default
survey this way:

----
# ubxtool -e SURVEYIN3 -P 27
ubxtool: enable SURVEYIN3

sent:
UBX-CFG-TMODE3:
  version 0 reserved1 0 flags x1
  ecefXOrLat 0 ecefYOrLon 0 ecefZOrAlt 0
  ecefXOrLatHP 0 ecefYOrLonHP 0 ecefZOrAltHP 0
  reserved2 0 fixedPosAcc 0 svinMinDur 300 svinAccLimit 500000
  reserved3 0 0

UBX-ACK-ACK:
  ACK to Class x06 (CFG) ID x71 (TMODE3)
----

For receivers that responded to UBX-TIM-SVIN, simply change SURVEYIN3 to
SURVEYIN.  You can optionally provide the svinMinDur and svinAccLimit
variables on the command line.  For example, to survey-in for 60 seconds
and 20 meters accuracy:

----
$ ubxtool -e SURVEYIN3,60,200000  -v 2 -P 27
ubxtool: enable SURVEYIN3,60,200000
[...]
----

To check the progress of your survey:

----
$ ubxtool -p NAV-SVIN -P 27
ubxtool: poll NAV-SVIN

sent:
UBX-NAV-SVIN:
  Poll request
[...]
UBX-NAV-SVIN:
  version 0 reserved1[0 0 0] iTOW 257578000 dur 23

  meanXHP -46 meanYHP -48 meanZHP -50 reserved2 0 meanAcc 392629
  obs 23 valid 0 active 1
----

Replace NAV-SVIN with TIM-SVIN above for Timing products. "active 1"
tells you a survey-in is in progress, but "valid 0" tells you it is
not complete.  It may never complete if it cannot reach the position
accuracy requested.

Your survey is complete when valid is 1.  At that point NAV-PVT will
show a fixType of 5 to show you it has entered fixed base mode.

=== RTCM3 Configuration

This RTCM3 example currently only works on the USB port of a 9-series
Time, Frequency and Time, or High Precision device.  It generates a
LOT of data.

To enable the RTCM 3 output on the USB port:

----
$ ubxtool -e RTCM3 -P 27 -v 2
ubxtool: enable RTCM3

sent:
UBX-CFG-PRT:
 PortID 3 (USB) reserved1 0 txReady 0x0

----

To be able to do anything else, you must disable the RTCM3:

----
$ ubxtool -d RTCM3 -P 27 -v 2
ubxtool: disable RTCM3
[...]
----

=== Exiting Survey-in

To restore your receiver to normal mode:

----
$ ubxtool -d SURVEYIN3
ubxtool: disable SURVEYIN3

sent:
UBX-CFG-TMODE3:

Or for a Timing product:

----
$ ubxtool -d SURVEYIN2
ubxtool: disable SURVEYIN2

== Constellations

For unknown reasons, one of the first things new users want to play with
is the constellation settings.  If you are headed to the polar region,
into space, or to Asia, then these settings will be of interest to
you.  GLONASS works better at high latitudes than GPS.  QZSS and NaVIC
are useful in Asia.  Otherwise, unless you have a Rubidium atomic clock
handy, or run 12-hour experiments with *gpsprof*, it will be hard for you
to improve on the defaults.  If you still must fiddle, then read on,
after completing the above section on Initial Setup.

=== Checking Constellations

First you must understand what your GNSS receiver is capable of.  Find
this out with the UBX-MON-GNSS message.

----
$ ubxtool -p MON-GNSS
----

If your receiver does not return an ACK-ACK message, then it is 7-series
or earlier, and only receives from GPS satellites.  Owners of 7-series,
or older receivers can stop reading this section now.

A u-blox 8 may return something like this:

----
UBX-MON-GNSS:
   version 0 supported 0x7 defaultGnss 0x3 enabled 0x3
   simultaneous 2 reserved1 0 0 0
     supported (GPS Glonass Beidou)
     defaultGnss (GPS Glonass)
     enabled (GPS Glonass)
----

That 8 can support GPS, GLONASS, and BeiDou, but only two at a time.

A u-blox 9 might return something like this:

----
UBX-MON-GNSS:
   version 0 supported 0xf defaultGnss 0xf enabled 0xd
   simultaneous 4 reserved1 0 0 0
     supported (GPS Glonass Beidou Galileo)
     defaultGnss (GPS Glonass Beidou Galileo)
     enabled (GPS Beidou Galileo)
----

That 9 can support GPS, GLONASS, BeiDou, and Galileo, and all at the same
time.  But in that case, GLONASS is turned off.

There are more details to see with UBX-CFG-GNSS.  A u-blox 8 might
show:

----
$ ubxtool -p CFG-GNSS -v 2
[...]
UBX-CFG-GNSS:
 msgVer 0  numTrkChHw 32 numTrkChUse 32 numConfigBlocks 5
  gnssId 0 TrkCh  8 maxTrCh 16 reserved 0 Flags x01010001
   GPS L1C/A enabled
  gnssId 1 TrkCh  1 maxTrCh  3 reserved 0 Flags x01010001
   SBAS L1C/A enabled
  gnssId 3 TrkCh  8 maxTrCh 16 reserved 0 Flags x01010000
   BeiDou B1I
  gnssId 5 TrkCh  0 maxTrCh  3 reserved 0 Flags x01010001
   QZSS L1C/A enabled
  gnssId 6 TrkCh  8 maxTrCh 14 reserved 0 Flags x01010001
   GLONASS L1 enabled
----

That shows 5 constellations, not 2.  Since GPS, SBAS and QZSS all use
the same frequency and modulation, they were lumped together by MON-GNSS
as simply GPS.

An L2 capable 9-series may look like this:

----
UBX-CFG-GNSS:
 msgVer 0  numTrkChHw 60 numTrkChUse 60 numConfigBlocks 5
  gnssId 0 TrkCh  8 maxTrCh 16 reserved 0 Flags x11110001
   GPS L1C/A L2C enabled
  gnssId 2 TrkCh 10 maxTrCh 18 reserved 0 Flags x21210001
   Galileo E1 E5b enabled
  gnssId 3 TrkCh  4 maxTrCh  5 reserved 0 Flags x11010001
   BeiDou B1I enabled
  gnssId 5 TrkCh  0 maxTrCh  3 reserved 0 Flags x11110001
   QZSS L1C/A L2C enabled
  gnssId 6 TrkCh  8 maxTrCh 12 reserved 0 Flags x11110001
   GLONASS L1 L2 enabled
----

There are several things to note.  SBAS is not shown.  Outside of FAA
requirements, SBAS no longer has any value to the user, and is simply
not supported.  Multiple signals per constellation are shown, and can be
individually enabled.

=== Changing Constellations

The 9-series receives a large number of signals in parallel, so other than
for testing, there is no need to change the defaults that listen to
everything.

Stepping back a bit, the 8-series is more problematic.  Many of them
can only listen to two out of the three possible frequency bands:  GPS,
GLONASS and BeiDou.  Most default to GPS and GLONASS, but GPS and Beidou
may work better.  This is partly because most GPS-only antennas can
receive BeiDou, but fail to receive GLONASS.  Partly because BeiDou and
GLONASS sats cover different regions of the earth.

If we first try to enable BeiDou, that will fail, as that would enable
3 constellations when only 2 are supported.  So disable GLONASS, then
enable BeiDou, then check.  Always check as u-blox does not reliably report
errors.

----
$ ubxtool -d GLONASS
[...]
$ ubxtool -e BEIDOU
[...]
$ ubxtool -p CFG-GNSS
[...]
UBX-CFG-GNSS:
 msgVer 0  numTrkChHw 32 numTrkChUse 32 numConfigBlocks 5
  gnssId 0 TrkCh  8 maxTrCh 16 reserved 0 Flags x01010001
   GPS L1C/A enabled
  gnssId 1 TrkCh  1 maxTrCh  3 reserved 0 Flags x01010001
   SBAS L1C/A enabled
  gnssId 3 TrkCh  2 maxTrCh 16 reserved 0 Flags x01010001
   BeiDou B1I enabled
  gnssId 5 TrkCh  0 maxTrCh  3 reserved 0 Flags x01010001
   QZSS L1C/A enabled
  gnssId 6 TrkCh  8 maxTrCh 14 reserved 0 Flags x01010000
   GLONASS L1
----

After a few minutes, if you are in a location which BeiDou covers, then
you should start to see BeiDou sats in the cgps sat list.  The 8-series
has many other constraints on setting CFG-GNSS, the masochistic will
need to spend a lot of quality time with the u-blox documentation to
lean the many ways to shoot themselves in the foot.

While the need for changing what the 9-series listens for is less, the
complexity of doing so is increased.  Not only must the constellation
be selected, but also the signals within the constellation.

Let us disable GLONASS on a ZED-F9P, then enable it, and check the
results:

----
$ ubxtool -d GLONASS
[...]
$ ubxtool -e GLONASS
[...]
$ ubxtool -p CFG-GNSS
[...]
UBX-CFG-GNSS:
 msgVer 0  numTrkChHw 60 numTrkChUse 60 numConfigBlocks 5
  gnssId 0 TrkCh  8 maxTrCh 16 reserved 0 Flags x11110001
   GPS L1C/A L2C enabled
  gnssId 2 TrkCh 10 maxTrCh 18 reserved 0 Flags x21210001
   Galileo E1 E5b enabled
  gnssId 3 TrkCh  4 maxTrCh  5 reserved 0 Flags x11010001
   BeiDou B1I enabled
  gnssId 5 TrkCh  0 maxTrCh  3 reserved 0 Flags x11110001
   QZSS L1C/A L2C enabled
  gnssId 6 TrkCh  8 maxTrCh 12 reserved 0 Flags x11110000
   GLONASS L1 L2
----

Note that GLONASS is still disabled.  Determining why is left as an
exercise to the reader.  The receiver must be told to enable both
frequencies before it complies:

----
$ ubxtool -e GLONASS,2
[...]
$ ubxtool -p CFG-GNSS
[...]
UBX-CFG-GNSS:
 msgVer 0  numTrkChHw 60 numTrkChUse 60 numConfigBlocks 5

   QZSS L1C/A L2C enabled
  gnssId 6 TrkCh  8 maxTrCh 12 reserved 0 Flags x11110001
   GLONASS L1 L2 enabled
----

Another reason to always check your work when using ubxtool.

=== Changing Constellations with Configuration Items

The astute will have noticed that the canned ubxtool commands, like
"-e GLONASS", send one or binary messages that may change a handful
or variables at once.  The 9-series avoids this mess with Configuration
Items.  These allow you to get, set and delete individual settings in
the receiver.  before continuing this section, read the ubxtool
man page on Configuration Items.

The CFG-SIGNAL Configuration Item group includes the CFG-GNSS items
of interest here.  So take a look at them, in the ram layer:

----
$ ubxtool -g CFG-SIGNAL,0
[...]
UBX-CFG-VALGET:
 version 1 layer 0 position 0
  layers (ram)
    item CFG-SIGNAL-GPS_L1CA_ENA/0x10310001 val 1
    item CFG-SIGNAL-GPS_L2C_ENA/0x10310003 val 1
    item CFG-SIGNAL-GAL_E1_ENA/0x10310007 val 1
    item CFG-SIGNAL-GAL_E5B_ENA/0x1031000a val 1
    item CFG-SIGNAL-BDS_B1_ENA/0x1031000d val 1
    item CFG-SIGNAL-BDS_B2_ENA/0x1031000e val 0
    item CFG-SIGNAL-QZSS_L1CA_ENA/0x10310012 val 1
    item CFG-SIGNAL-QZSS_L2C_ENA/0x10310015 val 1
    item CFG-SIGNAL-GLO_L1_ENA/0x10310018 val 1
    item CFG-SIGNAL-GLO_L2_ENA/0x1031001a val 1
    item CFG-SIGNAL-GPS_ENA/0x1031001f val 1
    item CFG-SIGNAL-GAL_ENA/0x10310021 val 1
    item CFG-SIGNAL-BDS_ENA/0x10310022 val 1
    item CFG-SIGNAL-QZSS_ENA/0x10310024 val 1
    item CFG-SIGNAL-GLO_ENA/0x10310025 val 1
    item CFG-SIGNAL-39/0x10310027 val 1
[...]
----

Notice that the BeiDou B2 signal is not enabled.  That might be because
when the firmware was written there were not B2 signals from space to
test.  Or maybe not, who knows, but we want to enable it to see if
anything changes.  So we will use the "-z" command to enable it, and
the "-g" command to check it in layer 0.

----
$ ubxtool -z CFG-SIGNAL-BDS_B2_ENA,1
[...]
$ ubxtool -g CFG-SIGNAL-BDS_B2_ENA,0

== Saving U-blox configuration

Now that you have your GNSS receiver configuration just the way you want
it, you will want to save it.  Saving is very dependent on your receiver
configuration.  For now, we'll look at the legacy, pre-9, way of doing
things.

A u-blox receiver may have any, all, or none of: Battery backed RAM (BBR),
Flash, Electrically Erasable Programmable ROM (EEPROM) and SPI Flash.
If you have BBR that uses a real battery, the battery will only last a few
years.  Some BBR uses a Super Capacitor that will not degrade with age.

The current configuration is stored in RAM, and will disappear on power
loss, device reset, configuration load, or configuration change.

It is not easy to tell what storage options are available.  There may
even be none.  You can sometimes tell if your device has flash with
MON-VER:

----
$ ubxtool -p MON-VER -P 27.12
[...]
UBX-MON-VER:
  swVersion EXT CORE 1.00 (f10c36)
  hwVersion 00190000
  extension ROM BASE 0x118B2060
  extension FWVER=HPG 1.13
  extension PROTVER=27.12
  extension MOD=ZED-F9P
  extension GPS;GLO;GAL;BDS
  extension SBAS;QZSS
----

"swVersion EXT CORE" means your firmware loaded from FLASH memory, so
you have FLASH memory.  It also means that you can update the firmware
on your device.

If you have no FLASH, then you will see "swVersion ROM CORE":

----
$ ubxtool -p MON-VER -P 18
[...]
UBX-MON-VER:
  swVersion ROM CORE 3.01 (107888)
  hwVersion 00080000
  extension FWVER=SPG 3.01
  extension PROTVER=18.00
  extension GPS;GLO;GAL;BDS
  extension SBAS;IMES;QZSS
----

The only way to detect the other storage options is to try to store
into, and load from, each storage option.  And see which worked.  I
leave that as an exercise for the reader.  Ubxtool just tries to store
everywhere and see what sticks.

First we need a data item to store.  The Dynamic Platform Model (dynModel)
is a common one to change.  See what it is currently:

----
$ ubxtool -p CFG-NAV5  -P 27 -v 2
UBX-CFG-NAV5:
 mask 0xffff dynModel 0 fixmode 3 fixedAlt 0 FixedAltVar 10000
 minElev 10 drLimit 0 pDop 250 tDop 250 pAcc 100 tAcc 350
 staticHoldThresh 0 dgpsTimeOut 60 cnoThreshNumSVs 0
 cnoThresh 0 res 0 staticHoldMaxDist 0 utcStandard 0
 reserved x0 0
   dynModel (Portable) fixMode (Auto 2D/3D) utcStandard (Default)
   mask (dyn minEl posFixMode drLim posMask timeMask staticHoldMask
         dgpsMask cnoThreshold utc)
----

You can see that dynModel is set to "Portable" (0).  The most common
default setting.  But you want to use your receiver on your boat, so you
want to set dynModel to "Sea" (5).  Then verify that worked:

----
$ ubxtool -p MODEL,5  -P 27 -v 2
connected to tcp://localhost:2947
ubxtool: poll MODEL,5

sent:
[...]
UBX-CFG-NAV5:
 mask 0x1 dynModel 5 fixmode 0 fixedAlt 0 FixedAltVar 0
 minElev 0 drLimit 0 pDop 0 tDop 0 pAcc 0 tAcc 0
 staticHoldThresh 0 dgpsTimeOut 0 cnoThreshNumSVs 0
 cnoThresh 0 res 0 staticHoldMaxDist 0 utcStandard 0
 reserved x0 0
   dynModel (Sea) fixMode (Unk) utcStandard (Default)
   mask ()
[...]

$ ubxtool -p CFG-NAV5  -P 27 -v 2
[...]
UBX-CFG-NAV5:
 mask 0xffff dynModel 5 fixmode 3 fixedAlt 0 FixedAltVar 10000
 minElev 10 drLimit 0 pDop 250 tDop 250 pAcc 100 tAcc 350
 staticHoldThresh 0 dgpsTimeOut 60 cnoThreshNumSVs 0
 cnoThresh 0 res 0 staticHoldMaxDist 0 utcStandard 0
 reserved x0 0
   dynModel (Sea) fixMode (Auto 2D/3D) utcStandard (Default)
   mask (dyn minEl posFixMode drLim posMask timeMask staticHoldMask
         dgpsMask cnoThreshold utc)
----

It did, but if we now power down the receiver, then it will revert to
the last saved configuration or default.  So we want to save the current
configuration in RAM, as much as possible, to whatever storage we have,
if possible.  The "-p SAVE" option does that:

----
$ ubxtool -p SAVE  -P 27 -v 2
[...]
UBX-CFG-CFG:
  clearMask: 0x0 ()
  saveMask: 0xf1f (ioPort msgConf infMsg navConf rxmConf senConf rinvConf
                   antConf logConf)
  loadMask: 0xf1f (ioPort msgConf infMsg navConf rxmConf senConf rinvConf
                   antConf logConf)
  deviceMask: 0x17 (devBBR devFlash devEEPROM devSpiFlash)
----

You can now power down your receiver.  Power it back up, and verify
with "-p CFG-NAV5" that dynModel "Sea" was saved.  Or, most likely, for
almost all GPS mice, not.

=== With Configuration Items

UBX-CFG-CFG, used by "-p SAVE", is deprecated in protocol versions
greater than, or equal to, 23.01.  It also works differently than before.  So on
newer receivers you should clear, save, and load configurations with
Configuration Items.  Before continuing this section, read the ubxtool
man page on Configuration Items.

As always, this example starts with a receiver that has just been reset
to its default configuration.  Check the value of dynModel in all four
possible layers.  One at a time, as the LAYER option to UBX-CFG-VALGET is
an index..  The layers, as used by UBX-CFG-VALGET, are:

* 0 -- RAM -- running value
* 1 -- BBR -- value saved in BBR
* 2 -- Flash -- value saved in Flash
* 7 -- Default -- the firmware default value

----
$ ubxtool -g CFG-NAVSPG-DYNMODEL,0
[...]
UBX-CFG-VALGET:
 version 1 layer 0 position 0
  layers (ram)
    item CFG-NAVSPG-DYNMODEL/0x20110021 val 0
[...]
$ ubxtool -g CFG-NAVSPG-DYNMODEL,1
[...]
UBX-ACK-NAK:
  NAK to Class x06 (CFG) ID x8b (VALGET)
[...]
$ ubxtool -g CFG-NAVSPG-DYNMODEL,2
[...]
UBX-ACK-NAK:
  NAK to Class x06 (CFG) ID x8b (VALGET)
[...]
$ ubxtool -g CFG-NAVSPG-DYNMODEL,7
[...]
UBX-CFG-VALGET:
 version 1 layer 7 position 0
  layers (default)
    item CFG-NAVSPG-DYNMODEL/0x20110021 val 0
----

The current dynModel is 0, and the default dynModel is 0, but you see
a NAK for BBR and Flash!  Nothing wrong there, it is just telling that
dynModel is not set in BBR or Flash.  We can fix that, by setting
dynModel to 2 (Stationary).  Here is how to do that in all layers,
except the default layer.

----
$ ubxtool -z CFG-NAVSPG-DYNMODEL,2
[...]
 UBX-CFG-VALSET:
 version 0 layer 0x7 transaction 0x0 reserved 0
  layers (ram bbr flash) transaction (Transactionless)
    item CFG-NAVSPG-DYNMODEL/0x20110021 val 2
[...]
$ ubxtool -g CFG-NAVSPG-DYNMODEL,2
[...]
UBX-CFG-VALGET:
 version 1 layer 2 position 0
  layers (flash)
    item CFG-NAVSPG-DYNMODEL/0x20110021 val 2
----

The -z without the third, layer, argument sets all of: RAM, BBR, and
flash.  After doing the above, you can read the value of dynModel saved
in Flash.  Not shown, but also in RAM and BBR.

The LAYER index is not to be confused by the LAYER bitmap used by
UBX-CFG-VALDEL and UBX-CFG-VALSET.  The bitmap for those is:

* 1 -- RAM layer
* 2 -- BBR layer
* 4 -- Flash layer
